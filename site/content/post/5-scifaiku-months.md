This is the third year I engaged in the discipline of writing and posting a poem on the Yahoo groups Scifaiku list I've been a member of for a dozen years or so.
This year, I wrote a short poem twice weekly from January till the end of May for a total of forty-four starting verses.
On this list, our members adhere to the Japanese renga convention of posting answering verses linked to the preceding one and yet shifting the emphasis to a greater or lesser extent.
With each contribution, another person can link on their own verse, plus the vagaries of email communication with its unpredictable delays can also bring about forks in the chain which further lead to the thread as a whole to veer quite a ways away from the idea that sparked things in the first place.
True to our haiku roots, the verses we write are as short as possible (in my case, seven syllable lines or a three-line stanza of twelve syllables).
This forces a person to strip away everything unnecessary while still trying to be at least somewhat intelligible.

The list is a little quieter this year than in the past, when we would sometimes have a half a dozen postings in a day from a number of different voices.
Because the list archives are accessible only to people who have gone to the trouble of signing up, it's a more controlled place than a wide-open forum on the net, and most of the members are people we've known online for years.
What I like about it is that the mere act of showing your work to someone else puts a charge into the effort of writing it that is extremely difficult to come up with all on your own.

There is a kind of discipline to produce according to a schedule like this, similar to the discipline needed to win NaNoWriMo, to make it through graduate school, or to learn a complicated vocal part over the course of weeks, which sometimes is at war with the idea of complete artistic freedom, but I'm thinking that this notion is something like a dangerous aberration.
I like growing things in a more or less orderly fashion rather than having a patch of wilderness that I just call a garden, and so I like to create things in a way that has some kind of rule to it, even if these are only rules I set up myself.
At the same time I was putting out these little poems, I also stuck to a schedule of writing prose, aiming for at least seven hundred words on weekdays, mostly not intended for anyone else to see at this point.
The rules are different now that I've finished the five months of posting and switched from writing to editing my written fragments together, and I'm still working them out.
I don't believe the kinds of rules you set up to be irrelevant.
For a while I tried keeping a bullet journal in electronic form the way so many other people have found compelling, but it didn't work for me as it turned into a chore that I didn't find rewarding enough.
The only thing I took away from that effort is the attempt to jot down at least one and preferably three concrete observations daily hoping that they will let me hang onto some sense of what my lived experience had been like in the moment.
In past years I maintained a scifaiku writing regimen, the five month twice weekly schedule during 2018 and 2016, a daily schedule for a year before that once.
