## Apocalypse? Not Now

I know some people who are convinced that we have only months to live given the
current political climate in the United States, that the kind of rhetoric being
hurled around means that nuclear annihilation or maybe biological catastrophe
or some other mass destruction come to the world taking most of us by surprise.
The idea is that the rules of society have changed so completely we can no
longer count upon collective good will that got us through tough times in the
past and that at least a whiff of what the four horsemen of the apocalypse
could decimate us (meaning wipe out at least ten percent of the population)
enough to bring a time of either anarchy or brutal repression. It may be a sign
of self-delusion if other people fail to recognize the warnings that are around
us. It could come upon us in a flash, so that the survivors of whatever
disaster are thrown into a scenario where it comes down to individual action
which will decide whether people will live or die, and any who have relied on
the existing social order will find it very hard to obtain what they need to
hold it together.

As with nearly all predictions about the future, I am less interested in
falsifying the assertions but in deciding for myself what it is that I ought to
do in response. I do think we in this country are in a dire chance of losing
a significant amount of what has defined our national character if we let down
our guard. Partly, this means that to keep our freedoms under the Bill of Rights
the thing to do is to exercise those rights: to speak out, to assemble, and to
protect our fellows from threats from the left or the right. If I really believe
the danger is that thermonuclear warheads will come raining down on all our
cities, of course, this will be mostly of symbolic value only, but somehow I
personally do not take that as either the likely or the most dangerous way the
story will play out.

## Geopolitics

I see a set of moneyed interests taking up residence in Washington mainly
interested in amassing even a larger fraction of the world's wealth. The vices
of racism, sexism, violation of personal liberties and so on are mostly just
there in service to this goal, not really the most important things to these
people, so long as they and their friends acquire more and more in the process.
A hot war with weapons of mass destruction flying, a seizure of all personal
property by the state would I guess not be in their best interest as opposed to
a gradual tightening of the economy in their favor and to the detriment of low
and middle income populations, exacting concessions from other countries mostly
through diplomatic connections but maybe through proxy wars in the Middle East
and places like southeast Asia.

The problem is that some people and groups will
be watching for this and will increase their opposition, not just through the
ordinary channels of government, but perhaps through the kinds of shadowy
self-organized groups we have already seen cropping up and causing havoc:
militias and terrorists and paramilitaries on both sides. The weakness of the
power grids, telecommunication networks, banking system, transportation links,
and dozens of other assets which individually or collectively could cause us
each significant pain if they were disrupted for even a day or two make them
obvious targets for these parties. All the government can do is to try to
infiltrate them and to clamp down on the population as a whole to stop them
from obtaining the means to cripple the nation. What would it take for an
imposition of martial law after a regional attack on one of these? How easy
would it be for foreign governments and non-governmental groups to start to
take advantage of our vulnerabilities then, including recruiting support among
our home-grown insurrectionists? My guess is that the crew of people who will
be in charge might be inclined to underestimate such risks because of their
preoccupation with extracting wealth for a little bit too long, and allow the
disorder to take root in a way that was not possible before.

So, my bet is that it is more worth worrying of a dystopian future than an
utterly calamitous one. I'm not saying that it is the most likely outcome, but it feels
to me like the kind of danger a sane person might consider taking a few
precautions against, in case everything all happens without advance warning.

## Preparedness

Living in blizzard country for so long through a number of blackouts has
instilled in me the virtue of having a few basic survival items on hand no
matter what the public mood is like. Now that we've moved out to the West Coast
my jump bag doubles as an earthquake preparedness kit too. Now, I'm not any kind
of
[prepper](http://www.prepperwebsite.com/) -- I haven't even gone camping since
I was ten -- but I recognize the benefit of knowing that I have enough on hand
to get by for a few days while waiting for things to settle down outside.

The basics include water, food, medicine, shelter, and safety/health. A little
bit of money can come in handy too in case the ATMs are offline, and there are
some hardware type supplies like rope and duct tape which can be used for all
sorts of unexpected situations. A radio which works without having to plug it in
and battery powered lights are good too. The kinds of things that you associate
with living in the wilderness like flints and compasses and shovels I think are
less vital for a suburban dweller like me, hoping that whatever might happen
doesn't force us to flee our apartment.
