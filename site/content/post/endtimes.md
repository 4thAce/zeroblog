## Apocalypse When

Some people I know are convinced we all have only months to live,
certain that the kind of rhetoric being
hurled around means that nuclear annihilation or maybe biological catastrophe
will take most of us by surprise.
The rules of society in the US have changed so completely we can no
longer count upon collective good will to get us through tough times
and that we're due for either anarchy or brutal repression. That it's self-delusion
to fail to recognize the warnings on our screens. As in a big budget film,
survivors of the shock will be thrown into a world where every choice
might decide whether more will live or die, where any shred of
the old social order will be lost.

Since predicting the future is always so hard, I think I'll do less well
in figuring out the exact course of any unfolding calamity than deciding for
myself what to do about it. I do think the middle class here stands a chance of
losing a lot if we let down our guard. It makes sense to build up reserves of
what you need to get by. If you really believe
the danger is that thermonuclear warheads will come raining down on all our
cities, of course, this will not help much, but somehow I
do not take that as either the likely or the most dangerous way the
story will play out.

## Geopolitics

<img src="/6029050434_960329feb5.jpg" width=250 height=250 alt="Map on wall" />

In Washington, I see a set of moneyed interests taking up residence mainly
interested in amassing even a larger fraction of the world's wealth. The racism,
sexism, violation of personal liberties and so on are mostly just
there in service to this goal, not really the most important things to these
people, so long as they and their friends acquire more and more in the process.
A hot war with weapons of mass destruction flying, anything to collapse the
world economy would not be in their best interest as opposed to
a gradual tilting of the game in their favor and to the detriment of low
and middle income populations. Instead of all-out war, they will want to exact
concessions from other countries through diplomatic connections but maybe
by reheating proxy wars in the Middle East and southeast Asia.

Still, I [might be wrong](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/opinion/are-you-not-alarmed.html?_r=0).

The problem is that some people and groups will
be watching for this and will increase their opposition, not just through the
ordinary channels of government, but perhaps through the kinds of shadowy
self-organized groups we have already seen cropping up and causing havoc:
militias and terrorists and paramilitaries on both sides. The weakness of the
power grids, telecommunication networks, banking system, transportation links,
and dozens of other assets which individually or collectively could cause us
each significant pain if they were disrupted for even a day or two make them
obvious targets for these parties. All the government can do is to try to
infiltrate them and to clamp down on the population as a whole to stop them
from obtaining the means to cripple the nation. What would it take for an
imposition of martial law after a regional attack on one of these? How easy
would it be for foreign governments and non-governmental groups to start to
take advantage of our vulnerabilities then, including recruiting support among
our home-grown insurrectionists? My guess is that the crew of people who will
be in charge might be inclined to underestimate such risks because of their
preoccupation with extracting wealth for a little bit too long, and allow the
disorder to take root in a way that was not possible before.

So, my bet is that it is more worth worrying of a dystopian future than an
utterly calamitous one. I'm not saying that it is the most likely outcome, but it feels
to me like the kind of danger a sane person might consider taking a few
precautions against, in case everything all happens without advance warning.

## Preparedness

<img src="/30062957192_106119086c_b.jpg" width=204 height=160 alt="Preparedness badge" />

Living in blizzard country for so long through a number of blackouts has
instilled in me the virtue of having a few basic survival items on hand no
matter what the public mood is like. Now that we've moved out to the West Coast
my jump bag doubles as an earthquake preparedness kit too. Now, I'm not any kind
of
[prepper](http://www.prepperwebsite.com/) -- I haven't even gone camping since
I was ten -- but I recognize the benefit of knowing that I have enough on hand
to get by for a few days while waiting for things to settle down outside.

The basics include water, food, medicine, shelter, and safety/health. A little
bit of money can come in handy too in case the ATMs are offline, and there are
some hardware type supplies like rope and duct tape which can be used for all
sorts of unexpected situations. A radio which works without having to plug it in
and battery powered lights are good too. The kinds of things that you associate
with living in the wilderness like flints and compasses and shovels I think are
less vital for a suburban dweller like me, hoping that whatever might happen
doesn't force us to flee our apartment.

## State of Mind

<img src="/30947468561_89f53ab6e0.jpg" width=250 height=175 alt="Lighthouse beacon" />

One of the most difficult things to do is to adjust one's frame of mind to
conform to what the new order will be. We are in the midst of installing a
Executive Branch in Washington based on disorder, bent on upending everything
that applied before. Their tendencies will be oriented toward the accumulation
of wealth in a hypercapitalistic fashion and a craving for power and prestige
on the world stage. The other two branches of government are still mired in
states of relative inaction because of the deep divide between the
congressional Republicans and Democrats, between the court conservatives and
liberals, which might mean that the checks on the power of the Executive
Branch might no longer operate properly. The uncertainty this produces is
reflected in the bond markets with unusually high yields.

In the country outside Washington there are going to be pockets of strong
opposition to the stated plan of action coming from the top, which has
might get ugly. In the past, unrest tends to get concentrated at a few
flashpoints where a riot or other act of violence can make things very bad for
a small population. There is probably no way to predict whether you will be
at one of these locations, so the prudent thing to do is to prepare for disorder
which might come suddenly, without panicking. It is a romantic idea to imagine
yourself in the midst of devastation and ruin but that is not the most likely
case. Lay up a store of mental toughness, something that will get you through
the time when it feels like the world is turning against you, and gear yourself
and those around you to endure whatever happens with the best you have to
offer.
