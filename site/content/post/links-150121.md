Like most people, I like roaming around the web looking for cool things, and sometimes get the feeling that I've run across something worth bookmarking, something I want to mull over in the future.
Some of them are worth saying a few words about, and I was thinking I would put these up on the blog in hopes that someone might find them fascinating too.

Here it's just the gradations of hue, across the spectrum and ranging from dark to light, given names that English-speaking people have a chance to remember.
When I used to be an active stamp collector, I remember puzzling over listings of one old stamp described as _crimson_ vs. _scarlet_ or maybe _carmine lake_.
This was long before the Internet existed to give some kind of easily shared meaning. <br />

* We really don't need more reasons to preserve the creatures we share the planet with. But sometimes we find out how our self-interest is aligned with their welfare.<br />
