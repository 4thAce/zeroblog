[Michael Dylan Welch](http://www.graceguts.com/) has been organizing National Haiku
Writing Month, more commonly known as
[NaHaiWriMo](http://www.nahaiwrimo.com/) during the month of February where
anyone can post their minimalistic poetic contributions every day.

spit drips
from her lips;    her boy stoops for
a good rock

lurid red

the place where
you used to park -  leaves
from last autumn
</pre>

<pre>
to begin again:
share your things,
try to be kind

<pre>
through life's
twenty thousand missteps we learn
the Tao

the place you knew
no longer is

mass job cuts
I look at myself...
could have been me

ancient oyster
one kimono fold
in the flow

two people
but one hearth:  the cherry
and its stone

I jab the button

no elevator

she has them look:
the transport that holds
their father

the harlequin's
