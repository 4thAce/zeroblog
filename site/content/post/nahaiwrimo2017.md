eighty year old
teacup -   its shards in
your two hands
```

```
early September
the smoke plume a
lurid red
```

you wave farewell...
something indistinct
blocks my sight
```
18
```
bagging the
lawn clippings  the scent of
wild onion
```
17
```
tossed out
with the suds, a crescent of
pearly light
```
16
```
the place where
you used to park -  leaves
from last autumn
```
15

to begin again:
share your things,
try to be kind
```

through life's
twenty thousand missteps we learn
the Tao

camp twenty-three
the place you knew
no longer is

a sudden arc
from the hose is it now
July?

before mother comes
hide the bacon,
this raw shrimp

he removes all
trace of lipstick

mass job cuts
I look at myself...
could have been me

ancient oyster
one kimono fold
in the flow

two people
but one hearth:  the cherry
and its stone

I jab the button

she has them look:
the transport that holds
their father

the harlequin's
salute -- just a few
fingers short

tap of
a hammer... violet on
violet...

too much plum wine
the moonlit path home
shines with dew
