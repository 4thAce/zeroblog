The office where I am working now is
going away by the middle of next month, so there is some urgency right now
to work out some
alternate work arrangement, and no way to rig up some sort of
a remote engineer position. And so, yesterday I was booked on the short flight
there, and ended spending about ten hours waiting
in airports because some cloud cover appeared in Los Angeles
and some rain fell in San Francisco. It was four hours in the morning flying
from SFO to LAX, and six on my way back. I was there to hear about what it would
be like to take a transfer from my company's office in Silicon Valley down to
California, but it was this experience bracketing the work trip which has nearly
completely convinced me that at this time in my life the prospect of moving
even that far from here is not for me.

The overriding reason I wanted to move from New Jersey back to the Bay Area was
the problem my mother was having dealing with daily life. Pam and I had a big
house by California standards, we had put down some roots in the area, and lived
pretty close to a number of her relatives, but I had the feeling that it was
time to attend to these matters on my side of the family for the first time in
a long while.

My mother has lived alone in the house I grew up in in San Francisco
since my father died five years ago, and while her vision and hearing are
still pretty good, she has had three falls bad enough to land her in the
hospital, and also is experiencing trouble with her memory. She just turned
ninety so these kinds of challenges are not unexpected.
She does have someone who stays with her for part of the week
to handle cooking and cleaning, but this isn't quite enough. Instead of being able
to visit once every year or couple of years, we wanted to be able to see her
frequently. By living where we are, we can go up nearly every weekend, find out
what she needs, see if there are any bills that need attention or simple things
around the house that need to be fixed, and help her out with the cost of keeping
somebody there to help her out. But we know that something bad could happen at any
time, and being stuck with only lousy ways to come up to see what's going on would
go against the whole point of coming out here.

That is the one thing that looms largest in mind now, not the salary or the kinds
of problems [to work on](/post/what-ive-done) and not the possibility of working for
some exciting new company of which there are many all up and down the region. The
living costs in California are unreasonable now, with our small apartment
giving us a third less area than our old house did, at a rent nearly three
times what we used to pay for mortgage and taxes. Since I'm not old enough to draw
from Social Security, I would still need some kind of high-powered position to stay
where we are.

The airlines were deregulated decades ago to give us lower ticket prices, which they
did do. The system we have now is both more efficient and more brittle, with
aircraft all operating at close to full capacity so delays affect interconnected
routes in a way they didn't used to. Economy class passengers receive an
objectively worse experience than before, and it isn't clear to me that business-
and first-class passengers get a lot of value for the higher prices they pay. I
cannot see myself relying on this for something important to me, not after what we
have already given up to move here.

And so I'm talking to recruiters and hiring managers and learning to talk about
my marketable job skills again. It's  tiresome at the same time as it is
nerve-racking but absolutely necessary.
