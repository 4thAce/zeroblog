We went to Massachusetts for the first long trip since the pandemic started.
It wa for a memorial for my wie's mother who had died of Covid-19 in May 2020 at age 89.
She caught the disease in a New Jersey nursing home, by the time she was admitted to a hospital there didn't seem to be much they could do to help.
Arrangements were made to transport her remains to where her long time home had been in the Berkshires where she was interred with no one to witness, which seemed a great lack.
The church was unable to allow a memorial service until just now after the vaccines became available

My wife and I spent four days there over the weekend, two around Boston and two at the western end of the state a couple of hours away.
We were joined by a few dozen family members and friends for a Mass and reception.

The flight over was full, pretty much everyone was masked, there were lots of small children presumably too young to receive a vaccine shot, there were no meals served other than boxed lunch affairs you had to pre-order.
It was, I thought, less uncomfortable than expected, though it was unfortunate we could not sit together in the same row.
Instead I sat next to a couple who bribed the flight crew for attention and favors with a box of See's Candies with great effect.

The hotels we stayed in had posted signs asking people who had not been vaccinated to wear masks.
Most people went around without masks.
I kept to my morning exercise schedule using their facilities as much as jet lag would permit.
Most days there would be one other person exercising early in the morning, but the last day a group of young girls, rather well-behaved, was using the equipment.
The attention paid early on to disinfecting surfaces obsessively was mostly gone now that it seems like the aerosol pathway is the only really important one.

Here's a picture of the sanctuary at the church, with the inscription over the altar which is the title of this post.
"Behold the wood of the cross on which is hung the salvation of the world." We were a socially distanced group spread around the big gothic church. The heart of the ceremony lay in the memories of the one it memorialized, her work counseling at Weston School of Theology, her love for her family, and her capacity for wonder at what her life would bring.

Flying back to California, I had a window seat from which I was able to snap some pictures of the weather and terrain below with their fascinating fractal contours. It was a calm flight without a lot of turbulence and the clouds were fair-weather cumulus with humped white shapes

When you fly east from coast to coast you may leave in the late morning and arrive at your destination when most of the restaurants are closing, and your body begins to wonder what brought on the night so quickly.

Now that we were flying west again our plane was chasing the sun and we got to enjoy six hours of late afternoon. Once more the body wonders what kind of sorcery was underway. In a daze we were relieved to make it back with none of the travel mishaps we worried about having actually occurred.
