Wallace Stevens had a day job (insurance executive). William Carlos Williams
had a day job (physician). I don't
think there are more than a handful of poets who sustain themselves solely on
poetry. Among prose writers, there are also notables who have day jobs: Ted
Chiang is one who comes to mind outside academia (technical writing),
and any number of those
teaching creative writing courses or supervising MFA students or working as
journalists or in other ways. It is part of the reason why people say that you
need to love writing in order to contemplate doing it as a profession, that
you'd do it even if it had to be wedged in between things you do just to
survive. Still, semi-maddeningly, there are those who have gotten to the point
where they are able to cut the ties to subsistence work, either because of a
fellowship or award or patronage of some kind or inherited wealth or purely on
the strength of sales. The path to this state is narrow and features plenty of
pitfalls, and usually it is hard to make the transition gracefully. There are
lots of people out there who are happy to dispense advice on how to make the
leap, whether it's by following a writing formula that will seize the market,
or by building a compelling marketing strategy and self publishing or by
enticing agents and editors to take a gamble on you in hopes that you'll prove
to be a lucrative property for them in the future. But can any of these be
trusted? Even if we assume that they aren't all out to fleece the vulnerable
writer psyche, isn't it just more likely that they are discounting the
importance of blind luck in climbing it up to that first rung?

There are so many stories of talented writers who didn't become popular until
after their deaths, something that most aspiring writers want very much not to
emulate. There are also those who have had a single early success but have not
been able to follow that up with anything quite so captivating afterwards, which
isn't a whole lot more reassuring. Somehow there are those who appear to lack
what most experts would say are essential qualifications to produce good
writing, but who have some amount of success anyway, in a way that always
manages to be hard to reproduce. They can become wealthy hacks churning out
saleable product like a factory, apparently without much trouble at all. And
then there are those who achieve fame and influence during their lives but who
are forgotten quickly after they are gone, as though they never wrote anything
of note at all.

It's a fine system if you are one of those who ends up on the plus side for as
long as you need it, a terrible system if you cannot make it no matter what you
try. That's the way it seems for any gambler, I guess. Maybe the only thing to
do is to just do what you can to get your best work out into distribution,
remove any barriers to success that are within your abilities to affect, and
hope for the best. It probably helps to make friends in the industry as best
you can, on the chance that one of them might provide you with the lucky break
you're looking for when the market is receptive to your work.
