I decided to write about some numbers about receiving rejections after I saw this tweet:

I don't have any problem showing how many rejections I get for the poems I'm submitting to journals, which I have available through [Duotrope](https://duotrope.com)
I went through my submission records going back three years to produce some graphs to give you an idea of what things are like.
Over this time I made 841 submissions (of course most pieces of writing were submitted multiple times) and had 114 of them accepted, either online or in print.
All of the acceptances were first-time publications (nothing was reprinted).

Although I'd been submitting my work from long before this three year span, the last couple of years have been a lot more busy than previously.
The first graph shows how the number of submissions has been growing from practically zero at the beginning to over forty a month.
It has been a time when I was concentrating on my verse and mostly taking a break from prose.

At the beginning, I was mainly sending out things which had been first drafts years ago, selected from the best of what I'd composed over a long stretch of time.
There are still lots of these to send out now, but I have mixed in maybe a third or a half of the pieces new stuff I've written maybe only weeks or a month before I got them ready to submit.
On the one hand these may be composed specifically to appeal to a call for submissions so as to have a better chance, but they haven't had a chance to improve through edits and rewrites the way the older pieces have had.
The question is, how many are being accepted versus how many being rejected?

This graph shows how the outright rejection rate has never been less than half of what I sent out.
The grey bars represent pieces where I never heard back from the journal editor, either because their policy was not to send out rejection letters, because my item was never properly received by them, mixed in with some which could still be under consideration.
So those rejection numbers for the last few entries can still go up
I found a wide variation between different publication for how long you can expect to wait for an answer, in some cases just a few days to over a year
