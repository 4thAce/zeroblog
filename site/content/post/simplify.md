A couple months ago we sent the clocks back an hour and it seems like my sense of where we are during the year has gotten a lot fuzzier than it used to be.
It used to be that I would look forward to upcoming holidays and vacations and new assignments with particular attention to the passing of the days on the calendar, counting weeks as avidly as an expectant parent might.
But now, it does seem like time passes by too fast for that, with seasons and big chunks of a year going by as if in a hurry.
I'm not the first person to bring up the unreasonable speed of time passing when one's salad days are long gone, it's just that now I can no longer ignore the phenomenon.
I find that if I'm am anticipating something I expect to enjoy, if I make a special effort to pay attention to the event so I can wring out every pleasurable detail the experience has to offer.
If not, it might feel like other fleeting moments which managed to slip away before I can get a proper grasp of just what happened, leaving only a hollow shell of itself in my recollection.
I've met people, become friends, thinking that we would of course have plenty of opportunities to see one another over the years, only to find ourselves flung in different directions.
All we can end up doing is to memorialize our good intentions with what passes for friendly relations on social media (a thing which is practically nothing at all).
And so I come up deficient as a friend, worn out by trying to share the moment, wondering what it would take to be truly alive in my relationships.
The demands of full empathy have a hard time competing with those fixed activities I won't skimp on: family responsibilities, church, art, professional duties.
I can sort of see why people who are in the public eye, who have heavy expectations laid upon them, really do need to have staff to help them manage their schedules, not just as a token of self-importance.
I am not the kind of person who can seriously consider going for a minimalistic lifestyle, the kind where you can find all the time for solitude, reflection, genuine appreciation of simple pleasures.

There were times in the past where I've been on retreat, killing long stretches of time, and I know it doesn't necessarily make me stir crazy.
I knew about mindfulness before this before it became something that was supposed to supercharge everyday life.
Sometimes I think I'm able to have a glimpse of awareness in the midst of action, something that brings me up short suddenly.

My need for stimulation coming from the outside world is I think less than what your average modern smartphone wearer expects, probably, though not as little as what people ten years older than me probably want.
So I am pretty well acquainted with stillness, comfortable with it as long as it it not coupled with anxiety.
When the world is flying apart it is a comfort to know there is a place which can serve as a center that does not depend on that much restlessness, a place it is possible to return to by stepping away from the tumult.
For now, though, as long as I have my regular job, it can't be a space where I live for long stretches of time, but only in pieces when I'm off the clock.

I have been reading and thinking about the philosophy of Stoicism lately.
Seneca advises his readers to strive toward a good death, which has to come to all of us someday anyway.
For them, it was important to act in line with virtue, not too concerned with what other people expect, and this should extend to the final passing.
How many people can say that this is to be their outcome?

Maybe life becomes more crystalline now with the heaviest part of my working career behind me, and I can remember to pay attention to those things which I have found nourishing.
So things which happen but which don't have the clarity of something really significant get lost when my mind clears out short-term perceptions.
I have started to jot down things which I have observed each day to try to capture life in the moment.
It's not an original idea, I know, this attenuated type of morning page discipline, but it really seems impossible to pay proper attention to the flow of life as it passes otherwise.
In nature, with all the variety of sense impressions that happen when one is immersed in a landscape or up close with some piece of ephemeral display, we almost lack the kind of language it would take to capture it.
People use their phone cameras to try to grab hold of these things, without the full-sense context, both still and moving images, and by the process of curation end up sharing the ones which are the most emblematic of the experience (and therefore least representative), and this begins to help.
