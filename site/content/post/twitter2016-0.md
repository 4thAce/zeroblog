While 2016 had some pretty awful things happen throughout, there were a number
of aspects I will remember with some fondness. I went through my timeline and
picked out some of the memorable ones. There were so many I'll have to
post this in installments. Thanks to all the people who made me think, who
showed me something in a different way, or who had the impulse to go and
actually do something.
