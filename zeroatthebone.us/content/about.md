* Besides the links on the sidebar here, you can look at what I've been posting up on [Medium](https://rmagahiz.medium.com/) now and then and at [Mastodon](https://noc.social/@Zerofactorial) or find out what I've been reading on [The Library of the Uncommons](https://books.theunseen.city/).
If you follow me at those places, I might follow you back.
