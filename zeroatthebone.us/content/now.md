* I am leaning into music and writing mostly now, trying to finish out the year strong.
These feel like such fleeting experiences, but I have not found anything that gives the same kind of satisfaction in the moment.
They both take solitary effort beforehand, the kind that can seem like it's not yielding results, but the work leaves a mark in you that makes a difference.
* This year's gardening is done with, and I'm starting to plan what will happen starting next year.
I learned some lessons about the long hot summer and the dry spell afterwards and with luck will be better prepared then.
* We aren't planning to travel far for the Thanksgiving holiday but do plan to see some family.
Christmas is already all over the stores so it will be time to put up a few decorations as usual.
