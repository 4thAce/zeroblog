* I have another Substack post ["No two pairs of eyeballs alike"](https://open.substack.com/pub/richmagahiz/p/no-two-pairs-of-eyeballs-alike?r=gnwin&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true) about the trouble I had when I was starting out writing seriously managing multiple journals which were soliciting work.
I talk about how my first attepnt to keep this in order did not work for me, and tell what solutions I chose to use instead.
