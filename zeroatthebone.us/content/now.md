# Current goings-on

* We have a house in a quiet part of Delaware we bought last October. 
A garden area is in the planning stages.
* After thirty-eight years of working for paychecks, I am enjoying doing just what I want to do.
It's a comfortable life.
* I write short poetry and have been doing pretty well getting pieces placed in journals.
I just finished up a four year stint as the treasurer for the [Science Fiction and Fantasy Poetry Association](https://sfpoetry.com).
* Thanks to a kind friend I've been able to take up the violin again, playing just for my own enjoyment.
* Our parish choir is preparing for Easter in a few weeks.
A couple times a month I lead song as cantor at two parishes, which I really enjoy.
* I am part of a small Dungeons and Dragons group playing at a local library three times a month.
This is one of the perks of not having to hold onto a full-time job.
