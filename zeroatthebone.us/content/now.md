* I've been working on a non-poetry project for three years and reached a milestone a couple days ago.
It's on to the next phase of editing and revising so that it can achieve its potential for strangeness someday.
* We're in that part of the country suffering under unusually hot and humid weather this summer.
I've been doing most all my outdoors stuff in the early morning or toward nightfall, just dashing out for little trips to air conditioned areas during the peak of the heat each day.
It's still not as bad as when the wildfire smoke got to us in California.
Plus, the garden is going pretty well with all the sun and moisture.
