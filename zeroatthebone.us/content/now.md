# Current goings-on

* The problems we had with the drain pipes for the front of the house a month ago recurred, so we had to call in a service to jet the lines clean again.
The real fix is to remove the evergreen trees whose roots are infiltrating the line, but we will need to replace them with something else to block the traffic noise.
* The fixes to the plumbing on the other side of the house are now finished, fortunately.
* We are starting to go out and enjoy the warm season out here.
