# Current goings-on

* Today marks the one year anniversary of our living in Delaware.
We are happy the way things turned out.
* Last weekend we went to the Philadelphia Museum of Art to take in a docent-guided tour of the Mary Cassatt exhibit.
I learned a lot about the artist and enjoyed the tour (and the luncheon afterwards with my grad school alumni group) very much.
* We have been watching the Democratic National Convention over the last several days and are struck by the change in mood from the first half of the summer.
It is as though the party has turned a knob and brought itself back into focus now.
