# Current goings-on

* The pace of activity around our bird feeders and occasional sightings in the neighborhood of white-tailed deer tell me that autumn is soon to be here.
I'll be happy to not have to cut the lawn every two weeks in a few months, instead switching over to raking up all the leaves from the neighbor's properties.
It will be a long several months before we have this many flowers outdoors.
* In a couple days it will have been an entire year of retirement for me.
I do not miss my most recent job too much, but sometimes think about previous workplaces with mixed emotions.
The key thing is that we're still solvent now without employment.
It's as though we did okay with all that planning we did, not taking too many big risks or too few overall.
* I have been working on a prose project for the last couple of years and am now reaching the end of the first phase.
It isn't much like any other thing I've read and I'm still making up my mind wheether I like the way it is.
