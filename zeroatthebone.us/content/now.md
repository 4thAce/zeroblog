* On March 25th we returned from a weeklong trip to the San Francisco Bay Area a week ago to visit friends and family.
We enjoyed the vacation, but it was not without incident because of a pedestrian accident that has left my wife unable to get around much with a leg injury.
My priority now is to help her as she starts to recover from this.
