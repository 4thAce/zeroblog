* My main responsibility now is to help my wife who still ostly bedridden with a leg injury caused by an accident late in March.
I've never been a caregiver before so I'm learning tricks on how to keep everyone's spirits up and how not to burn out.
As a result, I've scaled back some of my other activities to the extent I can do so without inconveniencing others.
It just feels like the thoughtful thing to do.
