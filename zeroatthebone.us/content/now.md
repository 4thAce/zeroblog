# Current goings-on

* The flood we had in our bathroom last week was because of a broken sewer pipe, requiring some heavy equipment to dig a trench and splice in a new junction.
Of course this didn't come inexpensively.
It will be a few more weeks before the insurance company sorts out how much we might receive from our homeowner's policy for this.
* While it's still to early to get anything new out of the garden, I've been finding a few chances to forage some wild spring crops around the place.
* We have plans to go off to view the April 8th solar eclipse at a location along the path of totality.
I was unable to do this during the eclipse of 2017 so I am excited to be finally be able to experience this.
* Because of the business about the unexpected home repair and the completely expected Easter activities, my blog post about the writing process is still not out yet.
I hope I'm going to be able to get this out there before the eclipse preparations take hold.
