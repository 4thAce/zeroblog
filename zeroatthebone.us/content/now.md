# Current goings-on

* At the end of this month we'll have been living in Delaware for a year!
Accordingly, I am starting to get a feeling of what is coming up now, instead of feeling like things are happening for the first time.
* A bunch of kabocha squash seeds germinated in the compost pile and I decided to let three of them grow, just to see what happens.
It's nice because these are really the only big, lush-looking plants out there now.
