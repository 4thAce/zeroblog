* My mood is still dominated by the current leadership crisis in the United States.
The hope is in our ability to continue to act as a people to assert what we want of our country.
Times have seemed dark in the past and I have not been able to foresee how we would see our way out of trouble then, so I won't offer my opinion now.
It's just that the last six months have seemed as hard a stretch as I've ever seen, and I hope we can make it.
