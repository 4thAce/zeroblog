* People are getting mighty concerned about the continuing drought, which has broken all records now.
After we pulled the trees in front of the house, I've been continuing to water the ground cover in that area every other day, and the little seedlings are doing pretty well.
* I have another set of publications for the last month up on the blog now.
I am expecting another group over the next two months I'm eager to have people read.
* Our church choir has sung at three Masses now and we have been getting nice comments from people in the assembly.
We are already starting to work on some hymns for the Christmas season, starting to get familiarized with them.
It's all still a work in progress, but it is also just good to sing something new together.
