* I'm playing with an idea I've seen other poets use successfully and wondering whether it is something I can run with.
I've written three pieces along similar lines and had two of them accepted for publication in the last several months, so maybe I'll see if I can keep on with it.
Maybe I'll grow tired of this technique, but it's been kicking around in my head for so long I think that won't happen right away.
