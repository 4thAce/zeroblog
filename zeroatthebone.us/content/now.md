* I allowed my Microsoft 365 subscription to lapse out of frustration with the way that company keeps pushing AI assistance into every corner of its products.
I was mainly using Word, which I've replaced with LibreOffice, occasionally Excel.
I had done a search indicating that OneDrive was part of 365 and thought that that was going to stop working after my subscription ended, but this appears not to be the case.
It was not doing a great job of running anyway, continually detecting file locks which shouldn't have been there.
By way of preparation I had signed up the Proton Drive privacy-focused cloud storage app which seems to be a good replacement anyway.
