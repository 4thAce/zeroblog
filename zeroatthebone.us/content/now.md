* I put up [a post on Substack](https://substack.com/home/post/p-153672536) for writers who are interested in boosting their commitment to writing by publicizing their progress statistics on social media.
I found this technique helpful and hopeit can be useful to others.
* In a few hours I will be part of the Midnight Mass choir at church.
It will be like a regular service but with a half hour of instrumental and choral hymns beforehand.
This weekend we will be reprising that program of hymns at the other church in our parish, and then that will cover what we've been spending the last few months practicing.
All in all, though, Christmas is lot less work as the lead-in to Easter when it comes to the time commitment in church and at practice.
