# Current goings-on

* This last weekend we had some relatives come visit us so we had our first housewarming, which was very nice.
* The whole garden is planted for the early spring and summer crops now that we have passed our last frost date.
I scattered some wildflower seed on the bare patch in front of the house caused by sewer pipe repairs in hopes that it will take off after a period of daily watering.
* April is looking like it will feature more micropoetry of mine in print than anything else.
It isn't a matter of what I'm trying to sell but what what is finding traction.
