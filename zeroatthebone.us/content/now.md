# Current goings-on

* The autumn garden is coming along now, with some arugula, pak choi, and spinach in the seedling stage.
The kale is still AWOL.
We are enjoying watching the new morning glory blooms when we get up.
The volunteer kabocha squashes that emerged from the compost pile have great big flowers and a couple of small fruit.
* I started revewing movies I have watched at Letterboxd where you can read my reviews [here](https://letterboxd.com/anderson_petaQ/films/reviews/).
