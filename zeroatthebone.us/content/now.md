* Somehow one of my folders in Obsidian changed the case of one letter, causing it to reindex and re-sync to the cloud.
I only noticed this when my Android phone app became unresponsive when taking  a long time to sync with the cloud.
It looks like sync was interrupted so a bunch of files got lost in the shuffle.
Fortunately, I save a copy of my vault to a USB drive monthly so I was able to restore from that disk over the last two days, using Git bash and WSL Debian.
I don't know how I would have recovered my setup using pure Windows tools
