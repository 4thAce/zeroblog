# Current goings-on

* Soil has been turned in the backyard garden, with plans to sow seeds next week.
It's still too early to plant anything that might be damaged by a cold snap though.
* After thirty-eight years of working for paychecks, I am enjoying doing just what I want to do.
It's a comfortable life.
* I've had a few more poems appear out there in the past week, online and in print.
* We are thinking of just what it is we want to do for our big vacation next year and starting to make some plans.
