* The first two-thirds of the year didn't go as we had planned, but it seems like the health challenges might be mostly behind us soon.
We hadn't had a chance to go berry picking the way we did last year, never mind the idea of doing some foreign travel for our 40th anniversary, but it seems like we are not too badly off.
Maybe we can pick up some of the things we didn't get to next year, after the holidays.
