* In 2024 I wrote a total of 193328 words plus spent 3 days 21 hours 53 minutes revising/editing
My mix of activities is changing so I don't intend to focus on these stats over the new year.
But I do intend to write something every day and to keep working to get my pieces out there.
* A few days ago, I happened to find out about the sudden death of a friend of mine.
He and I used to work in a team together about five years ago before moving on to a couple of other jobs since.
I didn't keep in close touch with him, but kept an eye on what he was up to on Mastodon.
That is where I saw a note by his wife saying that he passed away without warning and without suffering.
I added my words of condolence to his family to those of many others he knew, telling them how good a person he was.
