# Current goings-on

* We got our car serviced a week ago so that we'll be prepared for the summer driving trips we have planned.
* There was a car accident at the big intersection near us, which took the life of a twelve-year old boy, who was struck as a pedestrian.
A memorial to him went up overnight on a lawn at the scene.
