* We have been in a sort of drought this last month, with only about a quarter the amount of precipitation as the average.
I have been spending the last ten days making the wild flowers I set over the bare soil left by the tree removal were watered three times a day.
They have just begun to sprout so I'm hoping they will help hold the spoil this winter.
* My most recent month of publications is longer than usual this month not from an excessive amount of work on my part but just a fluctuation in the results.
As far as I can tell this month will probably go back to the ordinary level.
* I put on a new set of strings on my violin and it sounds so much better, exceeding my expectations.
I have no idea how old the previous set was, because it came with the instrument itself, which had been languishing in a closet for a very long time.
The new strings are much less prone to squeal, and have a nice singing tone I didn't think possible coming from an instrument without a pedigree.
