# Current goings-on

* Today we received some heavy rains in Delaware and found the shower stall off the master bedroom inundated with water.
When it started to run out onto the tiles we had to get out the shop vacuum to suck up forty or fifty gallons so it wouldn't ruin all our stuff.
We are awaiting a plumber to come in and assess what is going on
* We have the entire early spring part of the garden except for some of the herbs, because the local garden centers don't have all the plants I want.
* I am working on a blog post about how I fill the early stage of my writing pipeline.
My plan is to get this ready to put up in the next few days.
* The #monsterdon feature tomorrow evening is [The Werewolf of Washington](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070908/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) which looks pretty lousy, therefore perfect.
