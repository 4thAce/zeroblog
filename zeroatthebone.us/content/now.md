# Current goings-on

* Next week we'll be resuming weekly choir practice at our church and will begin singing at Mass starting in October.
I am really looking forward to seeing my choir friends and hope we'll be seeing some new people too.
We had only three men singing last year and could accommodate a few more to come up with a better sound, I think.
I took a look at some of the new music we'll be doing and appreciate some of the challenges we're going to take on to them justice.
* I have been working on a prose project for the last couple of years and am now reaching the end of the first phase.
It isn't much like any other thing I've read and I'm still making up my mind wheether I like the way it is.
