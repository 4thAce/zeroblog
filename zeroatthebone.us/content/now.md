* I wrote [a blog post on Substack](https://open.substack.com/pub/richmagahiz/p/steal-from-your-past-self?r=gnwin&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true) about how I set up my collection of writing snippets and use them to create new pieces.
* In 2024 I had a number of speculative, science fiction, and fantasy poems published which are eligible for the [special Hugo Award](https://seattlein2025.org/wsfs/hugo-awards/hugo-awards-information/) at Seattle Worldcon 2025.
