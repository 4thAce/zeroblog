* December is a busy month for music.
Our church choir does not put on a Christmas recital, but we do have new hymns to learn and more times where we sing them in a service.
I am also going to be leading the congregation in song at more Masses all the way up till New Year's Eve.
The nice thing is that all this activity takes me in the opposite direction from the heavy commercialism that increases every year.
* We will be having a mostly quiet time for the holiday season, having gone to one Christmas party thrown by friends and preparing for a few day's get-togethers with my wife's family just before Christmas.
