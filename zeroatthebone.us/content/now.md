# Current goings-on

* We had eleven tall arborvitae trees in our front yard which were causing trouble with our sewer line, more than once, so we finally had them pulled up.
The arborist told us it was odd because this isn't a species with a deep taproot, but it seems like the pipes under the nearby curb were old and shallow as well.
I was afraid that there would be a big increase in road noise in the house without the trees shielding us from this busy road, but so far at this time of year, it isn't that noticeable.
Now I'm trying to get some flowers to grow in the disturbed soil so we don't have bare mud all winter.
* If everything goes smoothly we expect to be welcoming two new kids into the family around February next year.
These are to be our grand-nieces or -nephews, one on each side of the family (and each side of the country).
Baby showers are coming soon.
