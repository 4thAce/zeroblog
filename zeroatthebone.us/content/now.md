# Current goings-on

* Last weekend was a holiday weekend here and it was a busy one here.
Part of it was unpleasant (car troubles) and part of it quite lovely (a visit to a winery with friends).
I am reminded that it is just a matter of weeks before we are into autumn, and the daily routine will change from the way it's been the past few months.
* A link to my Letterboxd account is now on my [Contact page](../contact) in case you want to see what I've been viewing on video.
