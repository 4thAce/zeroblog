# Current goings-on

* We are coming in to the hottest stretch of weather this next week with one day projected to be close to 100&deg;F (38&deg;C) with possible thunderstorms.
The pattern has been to have five to seven days of heat until a cool front passes through and temperatures drop for a couple of days, then on to the next hot stretch.
We do have air conditioning in the house which we run at the height of the day, but have also been going off to cool down at libraries, stores, and malls when we wanted to escape the conditions.
* We returned to Delaware in the middle of a pattern of hot and humid weather over the entire region.
Our little garden suffered a few losses from the heat wave, but a few of the native plants we have seemed to enjoy the change.
* Writing progress for the first half of the year is now summarized in the [Writing update 2024 (2/4)](../post/2q2024) blog post here including my June publications.
For the month of June I wrote a total of 18063 words out of 86043 total words on the year so far plus spent 5 hours 58 minutes revising/editing
