# Current goings-on

* We went away for about a week to visit a bunch of Pamela's relatives in Vermont.
It was all by car, a very long drive up the first day to Barre, where we stayed in a hundred-year-old home via AirBnB.
Coming back home we stopped for one night in the NY Capital District area where we lived in the 1980s, to visit a friend and to see how the area had changed.
* We returned to Delaware in the middle of a pattern of hot and humid weather over the entire region.
Our little garden suffered a few losses from the heat wave, but a few of the native plants we have seemed to enjoy the change.
