# Current goings-on

* After a tornado touched down [two miles from our place](https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/tornado-warning-new-castle-county-delaware-weather/), we are enjoying a nearly a week's respite from the oppressive heat and humidity right now.
Taking walks and running errands is quite a bit more manageable without having to feel like we are running a gauntlet.
* A year ago at this time I was busy arranging for containers to put all our stuff into so they could be shipped out east.
Life back then and life right now are worlds apart for both of us now, with new daily and weekly routines, new friends to see, new sights to see.
