* I am trying hard to remember what is good and beautiful about this time so six months from now when the ground freezes outside I can still enter into the experience in some way.
I also want to be able to remember the way the snow changed the landscape during winter, the first snowdrops during early spring, the way the green vanished from the lawn in late autumn.
So much of my first ten years of life comes through only in tiny flakes that I know I can't even be sure about any more, not just objective facts but emotions and attitude, and I wish it weren't this way.
