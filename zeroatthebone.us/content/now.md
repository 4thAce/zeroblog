* I am hearing about friends coming down with Covid-19 recently but it seems not to be part of the conversation any more.
I got my vaccination a couple years ago beecause I was thinking about my trip to the Chicago area this last weekend.
It was some trouble getting over the vaccine symptoms that week, but I feel like it was worth it.
But it masked up on my flights anyway since I saw hardly anyone else doing so.
* The wristwatch I had been wearing for the last year was damaged a couple days ago and the jewelry shop I brought it to told me it could not be repaired because of the solar dial.
I looked on eBay for a mechanical watch to replace it and the new ones I could afford were all made in either China or Russia.
I went with one of the latter because it had a [reputation of sturdiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amfibia) and would thus less likely to break on me again.
