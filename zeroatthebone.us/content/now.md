# Current goings-on

* We went on a few days' vacation to San Antonio, Texas, partly to view the total solar eclipse, partly to visit a few friends.
We knew about the likelihood of cloud cover before we went so we kept our expectations in check, yet the experience still managed to surprise us.
* We have some herbs we are snipping in the garden to have something fresh until the main spring crops mature.
* My complete [first quarter writing update](post/1q2024) is up on the blog.
I am still surprised one of these poems from January was recognized with a special award from _[Heliotrope Poetry Magazine](https://heliosparrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/The-2024-Haiku-Frontier-Awards-FINAL-Apr-4.pdf)_.
