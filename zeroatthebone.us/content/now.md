* I wrote [a blog post on Substack](https://richmagahiz.substack.com/p/keeping-track-of-all-my-precious?r=gnwin) about the unusual way I keep track of my poetry and short form submissions to editors.
It is a workflow that addresses the problems of dealing with hundreds of different pieces a year which are going out to dozens of journals.
* In 2024 I had a number of speculative, science fiction, and fantasy poems published which are eligible for the [special Hugo Award](https://seattlein2025.org/wsfs/hugo-awards/hugo-awards-information/) at Seattle Worldcon 2025.
For the convenience of nominators, my eligible works are listed on this blog in updates for each calendar quarter ([1](https://zeroatthebone.us/post/1q2024/), [2](https://zeroatthebone.us/post/1q2024/), [3](https://zeroatthebone.us/post/3q2024/), and [4](https://zeroatthebone.us/post/4q2024/)) by a special icon <img src="https://milkfish08.s3.amazonaws.com/photo/blog/award_star_gold_1.png" width=16 height=16 title="gold star" /> in the listing.
