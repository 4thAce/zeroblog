# Current goings-on

* There is a garden now, with 22 cubic feet of new topsoil arranged where once there was only zoysia grass.
There are lettuce, snap pea, and parsley seeds in the ground now in the early vanguard.
* One of my poems has been accepted and one put on a shortlist of submissions since my last update on the 13th.
Meanwhile I have sent out one more batch of five, but expect not to hear back for three months.
* Last night on Mastodon we watched the 1973 movie **Godmonster of Indian Flats** for #monsterdon and let me tell you that is a wild ride.
This is not a recommendation.
