* At my first appointment with my hematologist/oncologist we arranged to have a bone marrow biopsy done Thursday morning.
Once this is analyzed, we will be know what the correct therapies should be, I hope some time next week.
* For now, I am still writing, still submitting my work to journals.
The topics are colored by real life, but I think it might be possible to continue producing good work.
