# Current goings-on

* As winter recedes the planning for the small garden area is starting to move forward.
* After thirty-eight years of working for paychecks, I am enjoying doing just what I want to do.
It's a comfortable life.
* I have had a couple short poems published online recently.
This evening I will be at a get-together and will read one of my poems that appeared in print aloud.
* i don't remember learning the third position on violin being this fun before.
Maybe I'm misremembering ever having done so as a teen.
* We are feeling pretty good about the anthems our group is practicing for Easter.
The group is pretty small but the sound we're getting is good.
* Our Dungeons and Dragons group is just about at capacity for the space we have.
I'm looking forward to having some snacks available to celebrate some birthdays this month.
