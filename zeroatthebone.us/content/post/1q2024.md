The first three months of the year had the usual crop of surreal micropoetry and a few print and online publications of speculative poetry.
I also participated in an in-person event for a book launch for the Delaware Bards Anthology of 2023 where I read the mainstream poem included in the volume.

 My poem *The mirror-backed cabinet in oak* which appeared in the *otoliths* anthology last April was nominated for the 2024 Rhysling Award in the Long poem category.
 It would still need to pass the Rhysling jury to make it to the short list and be reprinted in this year's anthology and be eligible for voting.
