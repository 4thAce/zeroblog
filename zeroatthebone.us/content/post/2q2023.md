My poems ["long story short"](https://fivefleas.blogspot.com/2022/09/afternoon-of-september-21-2022.html) and ["sawdust protected our torsos"]((https://fivefleas.blogspot.com/2022/09/morning-of-september-23-2022.html)) which appeared in [Five Fleas](https://fivefleas.blogspot.com) in 2022 have been nominated as eligible for the 2023 [Dwarf Stars](https://www.sfpoetry.com/dwarfstars.html) award and are appearing in this year's print anthology. Also, [The closest traitor](https://mobiusmagazine.com/poetry/closestt.html) was nominated to the longlist for the 2023 Rhysling Award in the short category.

My poem [Serafina's Sparklicious Adventure](http://www.bewilderingstories.com/issue992/sarafina.html) was one of [The Order of the Hot Potato selections](http://www.bewilderingstories.com/anthologies/anthos2023/990-1001_antho.html) for this quarter at Bewildering Stories for the amount of controversy it stirred up. I am fine with that.
