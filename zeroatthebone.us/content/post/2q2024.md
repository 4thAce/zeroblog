Halfway through the year I've been happy to continue with the run of surreal micropoetry month by month along with some longer pieces in Star*Line, Dreams and Nightmares, and Sein und Werden. Even better was to see my first piece to appear in Eternal Haunted Summer -- a short prose piece with mythic resonances. 

My poem *[it is not]* which appeared in the *Heliosparrow Poetry Journal* [last January](../1q2024) was awarded a [Special Award for Micronarrative](https://heliosparrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/The-2024-Haiku-Frontier-Awards-FINAL-Apr-4.pdf) by their editors.

I am pleased to report that my speculative micropoems from 2023 *[by the fridge]*, *[egoless at last]*, *[tick]*, and *[under]* have been selected for the [2024 Dwarf Stars Award](https://sfpoetry.com/dwarfstars.html) and will soon be appearing in the printed anthology.
