During the first part of this last quarter I have been feeling as though my published pieces are coming along a tiny bit slower than the first two.
I do have some pieces slated to be published with long lead times, some of them into 2025.
There were a few journals in the last several months which had published some of my work but which are no longer taking new work.
I try to keep my eyes open for markets where I haven't already sent poems before.
This is time consuming, but the only way I know to learn about different submission requirements and editorial standards.

That said, I did have a little fluctuation at the end of September that brought a bunch of pieces out all around at the same time, both online and in print.
