Halfway through the year I feel as though my published pieces are coming along a tiny bit slower than the first two quarters.
I do have some pieces slated to be published with long lead times, some of them into 2025.
There were a few journals in the last several months which had published some of my work but which are no longer taking new work.
I always try to keep my eyes open for markets where I haven't already sent poems before.
This is time consuming, but the only way I know to learn about different submission requirements and editorial standards.
