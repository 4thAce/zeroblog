I finished off the year with a whole bunch of poems online and in print. 
Here are the ones which were published over the last three months of the year.

There were 94 poetry submissions published on the web and 31 in printed form, each total a record for me.
On [Duotrope](https://duotrope.com/) my acceptance rate is 36.1% per batch of poems, and in terms of the individual works I sent out, my success rate came to 15.4% for the last year.
This is above average for their other subscribers submitting work to the publications I approached.
I am happy with this and feel as though this gives me a boost to continue following the same method I've worked out over the past few years.
