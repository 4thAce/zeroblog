I had an awful time building the blog because of errors fetching content from Twitter.
This, I suspect, has to do with their new policies on unauthenticated access.
So I'm getting rid of my link files dating back to 2016 (though I'm keeping them archived just in case).
I'm still keeping my account, but not adding anything that isn't already going to be available on my presence on [Mastodon](https://noc.social/@Zerofactorial) or [Facebook](https://facebook.com/richard.magahiz).
In the unlikely chance you might have had something bookmarked, sorry. 
To me, it's just not worth the trouble.
