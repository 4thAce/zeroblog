Instead of passively consuming the nearly endless stream of content coming my
way I thought I'd gather together a few items to share with everyone here.

* Forty-nine years ago this happened:
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XEmn0uaQCYc" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
* I particularly like this polyphonic visualization

* We were moved when we saw the remnants of the Berlin Wall last October, so I
was pleased to see the site for the online
[memorial](https://www.berliner-mauer-gedenkstaette.de/en/)
* It's been over two decades since I was passed over for tenure but the feelings
this left behind are still pretty much as fresh as what I see in
[this account](https://www.chronicle.com/article/a-professor-and-his-wife-on-absorbing-the-shock-of-tenure-denial/)
of the experience. I wrote an account of my own experience
[on Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-be-denied-tenure-as-a-professor/answer/Richard-Magahiz?srid=XXIY).
* Along the same lines as the tongue in cheek stories of
[The Codeless code](http://thecodelesscode.com/contents) (unfortunately no longer
live on the web) are [The Unix Koans of Master Foo](http://web.archive.org/web/20180305224708/http://rationalfiction.io/story/the-unix-koans-of-master-foo)
* [Psychological safety in operations teams](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/login_winter17_09_looney.pdf)
* This blog post was inspired by
[52 things I learned in 2017](https://medium.com/magnetic/52-things-i-learned-in-2017-d9fb0040bdcb)
