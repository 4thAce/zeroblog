I've been keeping an eye on the some items that

* Something on a little bit of [fossilized legal speech](http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/what_judges_really_think_about_the_phrase_may_it_please_the_court/) you have probably heard at some time.
* I'm a little late, but I love this little video on the tradition of octopus for Christmas.<br />

Watch this video on <span style="color:#0c48fe;">The Scene</span>.</a></div>
* In my past life I did a few years of work on neutrinos, enough to find it that something as small as the Earth could manage to
[absorb them](http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/70763)
when conditions are right.
* True life crime can be more crazy than what thriller writers think up.
The story of
[Susan Kuhnhausen](http://www.wweek.com/news/2016/08/17/a-hit-man-came-to-kill-susan-kuhnhausen-she-survived-he-didnt/).
* You can search for any term you like in the
[Trump Twitter Archive](http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/)
to find out what our leader has opined on the subject.
* Some of these
[trilobites](http://www.spenceshalefossils.com/trilobites.html)
look ready to get up and swim around.
* I could watch these traffic intersection simulations
<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="Vh4PtFA"><a href="//imgur.com/Vh4PtFA"></a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
for far too long.
* Here is an exhaustive set of metrics on where to spend your
[retirement](https://wallethub.com/edu/best-and-worst-states-to-retire/18592/#main-findings)
around the U.S.
Some of the scores I find disappointing.
* I am of the right age to know about the
[B-sides](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/hit_parade/2018/01/how_does_a_b_side_become_a_chart_topping_hit.html)
they're talking about in this podcast, but not obsessed enough to know the right answers to the trivia questions.

I actually had a few more, but these are the best.
