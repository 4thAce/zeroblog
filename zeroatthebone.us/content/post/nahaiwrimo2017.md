For a number of years
[Michael Dylan Welch](http://www.graceguts.com/)
has been organizing National Haiku
Writing Month, more commonly known as
[NaHaiWriMo](http://www.nahaiwrimo.com/) during the month of February where
anyone can post their minimalistic poetic contributions every day. There would
be a prompt for each day the participants could, if they wanted, use as a
theme for that day's installment. I had fun
participating this year and would like to present a selection of what I came up with.

I've been writing in the English language haiku form for quite a while and
feel most comfortable when I can hold to a few guidelines for myself. Some of
these are in reference to the Japanese form with its rules, some are
adaptations to English, and some have more to do with the group setting of
many people posting their work all set off by a single image or idea.

1. The 5-7-5 rule in Japanese corresponds to something much more compact in
[English](http://www.nahaiwrimo.com/home/why-no-5-7-5). I aim for twelve English
syllables in the three-line form, nine for single line poems.
1. Poems should hae two images or ideas juxtaposed hard against one another.
This corresponds to the cutting word or *kireji* in Japanese.
1. Although the poems have prompts which might be considered to correspond to
the season word or *kigo* in Japanese, I prefer to suggest the topic instead of
featuring it explicitly. Reading a long series of haiku all using the one same
word as their main pivot is not so enjoyable for me. I know I'm in the distinct
minority of practitioners on Facebook in this area.
1. I am not at all strict about the orientation away from human preoccupations
toward nature. If it's what happens, then all well and good, but if not and what
comes out is human-centric, more like a *senryu*, I'll go with that too.

I wrote something for each day of the month, but not all of them are reproduced
here, because I have some other plans for some of them. Here they are, in
reverse sequence, each with
the writing prompt given for the day. A few of them have images that go along
with the prompt and my interpretation, which I have credited.

28: *NATURE (yet again—whatever you want to write about from the natural word,
and try to keep it a pure-nature poem).*
<pre>
two dozen eggs
and four besides,
some of them cracked
</pre>
26: *OUR (our what? see where that will take you, and try to use “our” in your poem).*
<pre>
spit drips
from her lips;    her boy stoops for
a good rock
</pre>
25: *TO (write a poem in which you use the word “to”).*
<pre>
all the way back
last fall's kim chee lifts
up the lid
</pre>
22: *LEAF.*
<pre>
then might they know:   someone passed this way
</pre>

</a><br />
21: *FALLING.*
<pre>
eighty year old
teacup --   its shards in
your two hands
</pre>
20: *NATURE (yet again, but this time think of something seasonal that’s unique
or special where you live).*
<pre>
early September
the smoke plume a
lurid red
</pre>
16: *NATURE (write about something natural rather than human-made that you can
see right now).*
<pre>
the place where
you used to park -  leaves
from last autumn
</pre>
15: *RETURNING TO (what have you often returned to in life, or would you like
to return to?).*
<pre>
to begin again:
share your things,
try to be kind
</pre>
14: *A WAY OF (either fill in a word after “of” or write a poem about a “way”
of some kind).*
<pre>
through life's
twenty thousand missteps we learn
the Tao
</pre>
13: *IS (use this specific word in your poem, but try to be wary of introducing
too much judgment into the poem).*
<pre>
camp twenty-three
the place you knew
no longer is
</pre>
11: *CLEAN.*
<pre>
before mother comes
hide the bacon,
this raw shrimp
</pre>
9: *A MIRROR.*
<pre>
mass job cuts
I look at myself...
could have been me
</pre>
8: *OPENED.*
<pre>
ancient oyster
one kimono fold
in the flow
</pre>
7: *HALF.*
<pre>
two people
but one hearth:  the cherry
and its stone
</pre>

6: *A DOOR.*
<pre>
I jab the button
twice...   still
no elevator
</pre>
5: *BECKONING.*
<pre>
she has them look:
the transport that holds
their father
</pre>
4: *HAND.*
<pre>
the harlequin's
salute -- just a few
fingers short
</pre>
3: *A (yes, just this letter of the alphabet—where will it take you? a what? or
something starting with a?).*
<pre>
tap of
a hammer... violet on
violet...
</pre>

I really enjoyed participating in the haiku month this year and saw some really
excellent submissions along the way by some really skilled writers. The plan is
to produce an ebook of the twenty-eight best of the submissions for release
sometime soon, something I will be looking forward to when it happens.
