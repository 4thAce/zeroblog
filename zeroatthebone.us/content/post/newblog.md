I'm starting this personal blog as a successor to my previous blogs:
* [Heavy Heavy Water](http://t2o.blogspot.com)
* [Poor Poor Thing](http://poorpoorthing.posterous.com)
* [Frabjous Times](http://frabjoustimes.magahiz.com)
* [evilHow](http://evilhow.com)
* [Worlds in the Upper Right Hand Corner](http://upperrh.wordpress.com)

I have some ideas of stashing some of my tech work here, links to my creative
stuff, pointers to things I've found on the web, and other miscellaneous items.
I have been on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/richmagahiz) and
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/richard.magahiz)
and [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/richardmagahiz/) and
[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rmagahiz) for a while now,
but it seems like social media has mostly resisted the idea of sharing content
outside of their walled gardens. It sure makes it hard to find the things
I have shared in the past without heroic efforts. So someplace where I can
put up whatever items come to mind and control on my own is attractive.
