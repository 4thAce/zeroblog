For every post here I write maybe three for my own use over on
[Penzu](https://penzu.com/)
as a sort of diary of what's going on. I've learned that it's too easy to forget
a lot sooner than you expect just what you were experiencing and saying and
doing if you don't leave some kind of traces for yourself to get back into your
head in times past. What I write are things too personal or
professionally sensitive to want to put out on a public blog like this, or more
often things that only I figure I would be interested in knowing about. For me
there needs to be a kind of a space between what I think about and what I put out
there, which I think is nothing like the way a lot of people approach their
social media presence.

I've been aware of the need for discretion ever since my days teaching where I
served on a super-secretive faculty committee for a few years. This was a group
that would decide academic rank and tenure and compensation which knew about
the most sensitive personal details of the careers of my peers. As junior member
I was tasked with keeping the minutes, and even these notes strictly for
internal use had to exercise caution on the off chance that someone would get
into a conflict with the school someday and be entitled to legal discovery of
these kinds of records. I knew the previous few junior faculty members tapped
for this role and could talk to them the rigors of what I needed to do then. It
turned out that despite the access to influential senior faculty on the board,
the post didn't seem to favor one's chances for advancement along the tenure
track, and I've sometimes wondered whether it could in part be a case of the
man who knew too much about too many people.

After then I have never wanted to be the tell-all type, not during the age of
personal blogs and not in the current age of social media. Some people say that
privacy is an illusion nowadays, that the public record and private databases
contain nearly everything about anyone inhabiting the First World. I figure
there's no point in making it even easier for someone potentially with
unwholesome motives to latch onto those scraps of private information about
myself. And yet it feels like there are things worth putting out there with
my own name on them, but things which I've shaped and cleaned up, mulled over,
approved to have associated with my public reputation. I've never tried
freestyle rapping but turning off the internal editor would be a sort of
challenge I think. (I'm able to keep it at bay during
[NaNoWrimo](https://nanowrimo.org/) effectively enough, however).

This is also why I appreciate the efforts of the
[EFF](https://www.eff.org/) and others to defend privacy rights in the
digital domain. They have an interesting guide to
[blogging anonymously](https://www.eff.org/wp/blog-safely), an idea that I think
received more attention before social media took much of the job of digital
sharing over from blogs. I don't know what the direction of free speech rights
and guarantees of privacy will be under the current administration so it just
makes sense to have a group dedicated to watching for such threats. In the
meantime I'll just do the best I can to write about things which I think won't
get me into trouble and are interesting to others whatever they happen to be.
